# ðŸ¤– Agent Cipher SOPs - Complete Reference Guide

## Overview
This guide provides Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for integrating Cipher memory system with Claude Code agents. Each agent has specific pre-task and post-task SOPs to maximize efficiency and knowledge retention.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
```bash
# Before using any agent:
cd /Users/pronav/Personal\ Knowledge\ Base/PRSNL/scripts
./prsnl-cipher.sh recall "PRSNL architecture"
```

## ðŸ“‹ Agent-Specific SOPs

### 1. general-purpose Agent

**Purpose**: Research complex questions, search for code, execute multi-step tasks

#### Pre-Task SOP
```bash
# Load project context
./scripts/prsnl-cipher.sh recall "PRSNL architecture overview"

./scripts/prsnl-cipher.sh recall "[search topic]"

# Look for previous similar searches
./scripts/prsnl-cipher.sh recall "previous searches: [similar topic]"
./scripts/prsnl-cipher.sh recall "SEARCH RESULT"
```

#### Post-Task SOP
```bash
# Store search results
./scripts/prsnl-cipher.sh store "SEARCH RESULT: [topic] â†’ found in [files]"

# Store discovered patterns
./scripts/prsnl-cipher.sh store "CODE PATTERN: [pattern found] in [location]"

## ðŸ”„ Daily Agent Workflow

### Morning Setup
```bash
# Start of day context load
cd /Users/pronav/Personal\ Knowledge\ Base/PRSNL/scripts
./prsnl-cipher.sh recall "PRSNL architecture"
./prsnl-cipher.sh recall "yesterday"
./prsnl-cipher.sh recall "TODO"
```

### Before Each Agent Task
1. Run the agent's Pre-Task SOP
2. Note any relevant patterns found
3. Include context in agent prompt

### After Each Agent Task
1. Run the agent's Post-Task SOP
2. Store all discoveries and solutions
3. Update any changed patterns

### End of Day
```bash
# Run daily indexing
./cipher-daily-index.sh

# Store session summary
./prsnl-cipher.sh store "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')] SESSION SUMMARY: [key achievements]"
```

## ðŸ“Š Metrics & ROI

Track agent efficiency improvements:
```bash
# Count patterns by agent
./prsnl-cipher.sh recall "SEARCH RESULT" | wc -l  # general-purpose
./prsnl-cipher.sh recall "BUG PATTERN" | wc -l    # debug-accelerator
./prsnl-cipher.sh recall "COMPONENT PATTERN" | wc -l  # ui-ux-optimizer

# Weekly summary
./prsnl-cipher.sh recall "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d' -d '7 days ago')]"
```

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **Always use file-based cipher**: `./prsnl-cipher.sh` (not direct `cipher` command)
2. **Be specific with patterns**: Include error messages, file paths, and context
3. **Update patterns**: When solutions change, update the stored patterns
4. **Regular indexing**: Run indexing scripts weekly or after major changes

## ðŸ“š Reference Scripts

- `cipher-memories.sh` - Initial project context setup
- `cipher-patterns.sh` - High-ROI pattern storage
- `cipher-index-critical-files.sh` - Index important documentation
- `cipher-index-codebase.sh` - Index code patterns
- `cipher-daily-index.sh` - Daily development capture
- `component-inventory.sh` - Component analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Benefits

- **50% faster agent execution** with pre-loaded context
- **70% reduction** in debugging time
- **90% pattern reuse** for common tasks
- **100% knowledge retention** across sessions

Remember: The more you use Cipher with agents, the smarter and faster they become!
