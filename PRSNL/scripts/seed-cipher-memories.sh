cipher "Frontend ports: Development=3004, Production container=3003. Always use 3004 for npm run dev. Port 3003 is for production deployments only."

cipher "Azure OpenAI deployments: gpt-4.1 (main reasoning), text-embedding-ada-002 (embeddings). API version: 2025-01-01-preview"

cipher "Authentication: Keycloak (port 8080) for SSO, FusionAuth (port 9011) for user management. JWT tokens: 1-hour access, 7-day refresh"

# Development Patterns
