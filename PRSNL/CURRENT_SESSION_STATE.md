# CURRENT SESSION STATE
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-01 22:10:00
**Session Status:** COMPLETED - Cipher Integration Successful
**Phase:** Documentation Update

## üéØ Current Session Overview
**Primary Focus:** Cipher Azure OpenAI Integration COMPLETED
**Started:** Resume from previous session with auth errors
**Current Task:** Documentation updates after successful integration

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION (2025-08-01 Evening)

### **1. Discovered and Fixed Cipher Configuration Issues** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Cipher v0.2.0 doesn't natively support Azure OpenAI
**Solution:** Created SDK proxy using official OpenAI Python library
- Azure proxy script: `/scripts/cipher-azure-proxy.py`
- Runs on port 8002
- Handles auth header differences automatically

### **2. Created MCP Integration** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Cipher was NOT configured as MCP server (no automatic memory)
**Solution:** 
- Created wrapper: `/scripts/cipher-mcp-wrapper.sh`
- Updated `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Added Cipher as MCP server with Azure proxy support

### **3. Fixed Multiple Configuration Issues** ‚úÖ
- Found correct config location: `~/.cipher/memAgent/cipher.yml`
- Fixed baseUrl vs baseURL capitalization
- Set proper environment variables
- Tested successfully with manual commands

## ‚úÖ CIPHER INTEGRATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### **Final Working Configuration:**
1. **Claude Code (not Desktop)** - MCP servers configured
2. **Three MCP servers active:** puppeteer, playwright, cipher
3. **Azure OpenAI working** with gpt-4.1 deployment
4. **Cipher responding** to queries through MCP

### **Key Fix That Worked:**
1. Used `provider: azure` (not `azure_openai`) in cipher.yml
2. Added dummy `OPENAI_API_KEY` to bypass CLI validation bug
3. Created complete cipher.yml with all required sections
4. Used absolute path for config file

## üö® IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES

### **What Was Actually Missing:**
- ‚ùå Cipher was NOT an MCP server (just CLI tool)
- ‚ùå No automatic memory persistence
- ‚ùå Conversations were NOT being saved
- ‚ùå Azure OpenAI auth wasn't working

### **What's Now Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ Azure OpenAI proxy handles auth differences
- ‚úÖ Cipher configured as MCP server
- ‚úÖ Automatic memory will work after restart
- ‚úÖ Full integration with Claude Code

## üìÅ Key Files Created/Modified

1. **`.mcp.json`** - Project-level MCP configuration (overrides global)
2. **`memAgent/cipher.yml`** - Cipher agent configuration with Azure settings
3. **`/docs/CIPHER_AZURE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`** - Complete troubleshooting guide
4. **Multiple helper scripts** - Proxy implementations and wrappers
5. **Committed and pushed** - All changes saved to git (commit: 3ffae6f)

## üîß Services Running
- Backend: 8000
- Frontend: 3004  
- PostgreSQL: 5432
- DragonflyDB: 6379
- **Cipher Azure Proxy: 8002** (NEW)

## üìã Remaining TODOs
- [ ] Fix authentication guard to redirect to login page (TODO #36)
- [ ] Fix multiple API calls issue in capture feature
- [ ] Complete Playwright test with proper login flow

## üí° Session Insights
1. Always verify MCP integration, not just CLI functionality
2. Azure OpenAI requires SDK approach, not raw API translation
3. Config file locations matter (`memAgent/cipher.yml` vs `cipher.yml`)
4. Restart required for MCP servers to connect

**Session Ready for Restart:** Please restart Claude Desktop to activate MCP
**Next Session:** Test automatic memory persistence and continue with auth fixes
