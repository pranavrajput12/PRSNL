- Issue was missing database connection imports

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added `get_db_connection` import to `codemirror_service.py`
2. Verified `auth.py` returns proper User object
3. Tested endpoint with PRSNL repo ID: `1cbb79ce-8994-490c-87ce-56911ab03807`

**Working Test Command:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/codemirror/analyze/1cbb79ce-8994-490c-87ce-56911ab03807" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
