# CURRENT SESSION STATE
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-01 19:15:00
**Session Status:** RESTART REQUIRED FOR MCP TESTING
**Phase:** Cipher MCP Integration - Final Configuration

## üéØ Current Session Overview
**Primary Focus:** Cipher Azure OpenAI Integration for Automatic Memory
**Started:** Resume from previous session with auth errors
**Current Task:** MCP Server Configuration Complete - Restart Required

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION (2025-08-01 Evening)

### **1. Discovered and Fixed Cipher Configuration Issues** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Cipher v0.2.0 doesn't natively support Azure OpenAI
**Solution:** Created SDK proxy using official OpenAI Python library
- Azure proxy script: `/scripts/cipher-azure-proxy.py`
- Runs on port 8002
- Handles auth header differences automatically

### **2. Created MCP Integration** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Cipher was NOT configured as MCP server (no automatic memory)
**Solution:** 
- Created wrapper: `/scripts/cipher-mcp-wrapper.sh`
- Updated `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Added Cipher as MCP server with Azure proxy support

### **3. Fixed Multiple Configuration Issues** ‚úÖ
- Found correct config location: `~/.cipher/memAgent/cipher.yml`
- Fixed baseUrl vs baseURL capitalization
- Set proper environment variables
- Tested successfully with manual commands

## üìù CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

### **RESTART CLAUDE DESKTOP NOW**
1. **Quit Claude Desktop completely** (Cmd+Q)
2. **Restart Claude Desktop**
3. **Look for MCP indicator** in bottom-right of input box
4. **Verify "cipher" appears** in the server list

### **After Restart:**
1. Test automatic memory: "Hello, this is a test message for Cipher"
2. In terminal: `cipher recall "test message"`
3. Verify the message was automatically saved

## üö® IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES

### **What Was Actually Missing:**
- ‚ùå Cipher was NOT an MCP server (just CLI tool)
- ‚ùå No automatic memory persistence
- ‚ùå Conversations were NOT being saved
- ‚ùå Azure OpenAI auth wasn't working

### **What's Now Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ Azure OpenAI proxy handles auth differences
- ‚úÖ Cipher configured as MCP server
- ‚úÖ Automatic memory will work after restart
- ‚úÖ Full integration with Claude Code

## üìÅ Key Files Created/Modified

1. **`/scripts/cipher-azure-proxy.py`** - Azure OpenAI SDK proxy
2. **`/scripts/cipher-mcp-wrapper.sh`** - MCP wrapper script
3. **`~/.cipher/memAgent/cipher.yml`** - Cipher config pointing to proxy
4. **`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`** - MCP config
5. **`/docs/CIPHER_MCP_SETUP.md`** - Complete setup documentation

## üîß Services Running
- Backend: 8000
- Frontend: 3004  
- PostgreSQL: 5432
- DragonflyDB: 6379
- **Cipher Azure Proxy: 8002** (NEW)

## üìã Remaining TODOs
- [ ] Fix authentication guard to redirect to login page (TODO #36)
- [ ] Fix multiple API calls issue in capture feature
- [ ] Complete Playwright test with proper login flow

## üí° Session Insights
1. Always verify MCP integration, not just CLI functionality
2. Azure OpenAI requires SDK approach, not raw API translation
3. Config file locations matter (`memAgent/cipher.yml` vs `cipher.yml`)
4. Restart required for MCP servers to connect

**Session Ready for Restart:** Please restart Claude Desktop to activate MCP
**Next Session:** Test automatic memory persistence and continue with auth fixes
