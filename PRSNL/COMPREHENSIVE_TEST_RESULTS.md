- [x] No duplicate slugs
- [x] Frontend compilation successful
- [x] Visual rendering confirmed
- [x] Core features functional
- [ ] Backend API tests (pending startup)

## 📝 Test Commands Used

```bash
# Route testing
node tests/phase1-route-tests.cjs

# Database testing
psql -U pronav -p 5432 -d prsnl -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM content_urls;"

# Feature testing
node tests/feature-functionality-test.cjs

# Visual testing
