### Previous Fixes (2025-01-08)

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Chat Date-Based Queries**
   - Issue: Chat endpoint did not understand date-based queries (e.g., "yesterday", "this week").
   - Root Cause: Missing date parsing logic and SQL query modification.
   - Fix: Implemented date parsing in `ws.py` and integrated date filters into the SQL query.
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED

2. **Test Data Scripts Created**
   - Issue: Lack of comprehensive test data for development and testing.
   - Root Cause: No dedicated scripts for populating diverse test items and activity patterns.
   - Fix: Created `populate_test_data.py` and `generate_activity_data.py`.
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED

3. **Database Backup Scripts Created**
   - Issue: No automated solution for backing up and restoring the database.
   - Root Cause: Missing scripts for pg_dump, restore, and cleanup.
   - Fix: Created `backup_database.sh`, `restore_database.sh`, and `cleanup_old_backups.py`.
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED

4. **Chatbot Enhancements**
   - Issue: Limited conversational continuity, basic query understanding, and suboptimal knowledge retrieval.
   - Root Cause: Chat history not fully utilized, simple keyword extraction, and lack of hybrid search/context summarization.
   - Fix: Implemented chat history continuity, enhanced query pre-processing with expansion, optimized RAG with hybrid search and re-ranking, and improved context formulation with item summarization.
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED

5. **Frontend Connection Refused Error**
   - Issue: localhost refused to connect, ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
   - Root Cause: Frontend dev server was not running
   - Fix: Started Vite dev server with `npm run dev`
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED

2. **Chat Feature Not Working**
   - Issue: Chat messages got no response, WebSocket connection failed
   - Root Cause: Multiple issues - proxy config, hardcoded port, API prefix mismatch
   - Fix: Updated Vite proxy, fixed WebSocket port, implemented RAG
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED - Chat fully functional

3. **Ollama References Throughout System**
   - Issue: Docker kept pulling Ollama image despite Azure OpenAI usage
   - Root Cause: Legacy Ollama configs in docker-compose files
   - Fix: Removed ALL Ollama references from system
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED - Azure OpenAI exclusive

4. **API Prefix Mismatch**
   - Issue: Frontend using /api/v1, backend expecting /api
   - Root Cause: Inconsistent API prefix configuration
   - Fix: Updated all frontend API calls to use /api
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED

5. **Frontend-Backend Connection Issues**
   - Issue: Proxy pointing to 'backend:8000' instead of 'localhost:8000'
   - Root Cause: Docker service name used in dev config
   - Fix: Updated Vite proxy configuration
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED

6. **Empty Timeline/Database**
   - Issue: No content displayed, database was empty
   - Root Cause: Docker rebuild cleared database
   - Fix: Added 15 test items via add_simple_content.py script
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED

7. **Videos Not Displaying**
   - Issue: Video pages showed "video not found"
   - Root Cause: Platform metadata incorrect, component spreading undefined
   - Fix: Fixed platform detection and video component
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED

8. **Local Domain Setup Attempted**
   - Tried setting up prsnl.local domain access
   - Created nginx configs and local domain management scripts
   - Status: ⚠️ Requires manual sudo configuration
   - Workaround: Continue using localhost:3002

### Task Reassignment (2025-01-08):
- **CLAUDE**: Now handles ALL complex tasks (frontend, backend, integration)
- **WINDSURF**: Reassigned to simple frontend tasks only (styling, tooltips, etc.)
- **GEMINI**: Reassigned to simple backend tasks only (tests, scripts, logging)
