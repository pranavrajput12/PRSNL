   - Root Cause: Missing date parsing logic and SQL query modification.
   - Fix: Implemented date parsing in `ws.py` and integrated date filters into the SQL query.
   - Status: ✅ RESOLVED

2. **Test Data Scripts Created**
   - Issue: Lack of comprehensive test data for development and testing.
   - Root Cause: No dedicated scripts for populating diverse test items and activity patterns.
