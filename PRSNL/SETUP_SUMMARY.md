# üöÄ PRSNL Mac Mini M4 Setup Summary

## üìä Current Status (2025-07-18)

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **pgvector Extension**: Successfully installed v0.8.0 for PostgreSQL 16
2. **Database Configuration**: PostgreSQL configured for port 5432
3. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive setup guides

### üî¥ Issues Encountered
1. **Shell Environment**: Cannot execute brew/python commands directly from Claude
2. **PostgreSQL Status**: Unable to verify if service is running
3. **Python Environment**: Cannot install packages via command line

## üíæ About Your Data

**Your data should be PRESERVED** if PostgreSQL was previously running. According to the session notes from earlier today, you manually created:

1. **users table** - For user authentication
2. **items table** - For storing PRSNL items

These tables should still exist in your database unless PostgreSQL was completely uninstalled.

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Setup Required

Since I cannot execute commands properly in the current shell environment, you'll need to run these commands manually:

### Step 1: Verify PostgreSQL is Running
```bash
# Add Homebrew to PATH (if needed)
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# Check PostgreSQL status
brew services list | grep postgresql

# If not running, start it
brew services start postgresql@16

# Verify database exists
psql -U pronav -d prsnl -c "\dt"
```

### Step 2: Check Your Data
```bash
# Connect to database
psql -U pronav -d prsnl

# In psql prompt, run:
\dt                          -- List all tables
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;  -- Count users
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM items;  -- Count items
\dx vector                   -- Check pgvector extension
\q                          -- Exit
```

### Step 3: Install Python (if needed)
```bash
# Check if Python is installed
python3 --version

# If not installed
brew install python@3.11
```

### Step 4: Set Up Backend
```bash
cd "/Users/pronav/Personal Knowledge Base/PRSNL/backend"

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run migrations (this will create any missing tables)
alembic upgrade head

# Start backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Step 5: Set Up Frontend
```bash
# In a new terminal
cd "/Users/pronav/Personal Knowledge Base/PRSNL/frontend"

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start frontend
npm run dev -- --port 3004
```

### Step 6: Configure Authentication (Optional)
```bash
# Start Colima if using Docker
colima start

# Start auth services
cd "/Users/pronav/Personal Knowledge Base/PRSNL"
docker-compose -f docker-compose.auth.yml up -d
```

## üîç Verification Checklist

After running the above commands, verify:

- [ ] PostgreSQL is running (`brew services list`)
- [ ] Database has your data (`psql -U pronav -d prsnl -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"`)
- [ ] pgvector is installed (`psql -U pronav -d prsnl -c "\dx vector"`)
- [ ] Backend starts without errors (http://localhost:8000)
- [ ] Frontend loads properly (http://localhost:3004)
- [ ] Login page appears (may show errors until auth is configured)

## üìù Important Notes

1. **Data Preservation**: Your existing database data should be intact. The manual table creation from this morning means you have the basic schema.

2. **Authentication**: The 500 errors on login are expected until you configure users in Keycloak/FusionAuth.

3. **Migrations**: Running `alembic upgrade head` will create any additional tables needed by the application without affecting existing data.

4. **Shell Issues**: The current Claude session has limited shell access. All commands need to be run manually in your terminal.

## üÜò If Data is Missing

If your tables are empty or missing:

1. Check if you have database backups
2. The manual schema creation from earlier today is documented in `SESSION_NOTES_MAC_MINI_M4.md`
3. User data would need to be re-imported from backups or recreated

## üìû Next Steps

1. Run the manual setup commands above
2. Verify your data is intact
3. Complete the authentication provider setup
4. Test the full application flow

The infrastructure is ready - you just need to execute the commands manually due to the shell environment limitations in this session.
