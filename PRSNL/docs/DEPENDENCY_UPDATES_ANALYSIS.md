# Update these first for immediate benefits
fastapi>=0.116.1
openai>=1.96.0
sqlalchemy>=2.0.41
sentry-sdk>=2.33.0
```

### Phase 2: AI & Processing Enhancements (Week 2)
```python

## New Feature Integration Opportunities

### 1. **CrewAI Flows + LangGraph Checkpointing**
Combine CrewAI's new Flow system with LangGraph's checkpointing for persistent, resumable workflows:
```python
# Persistent document processing workflow
@flow
async def document_processing_flow():
    with checkpointing():
        # Process continues even after crashes
        pass
```

### 2. **OpenAI Structured Outputs + Document Processing**
Use OpenAI's guaranteed JSON outputs for reliable data extraction:
```python
# Guaranteed structured extraction
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    response_format={"type": "json_object"},
    messages=[...]
)
```

### 3. **FastAPI WebSocket + Celery Progress**
Enhanced real-time progress updates with improved WebSocket handling:
```python
# Better real-time updates
@app.websocket("/ws/progress/{task_id}")
async def progress_websocket(websocket: WebSocket, task_id: str):
    # Improved connection handling
    pass
```

### 4. **SQLAlchemy Native JSON + Document Metadata**
Leverage native JSON operations for faster metadata queries:
```python
# Fast JSON path queries
query = select(Document).where(
    Document.metadata['tags'].contains(['ai', 'processing'])
)
```

## Risk Assessment
