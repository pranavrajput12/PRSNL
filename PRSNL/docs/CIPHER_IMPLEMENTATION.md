# Cipher Memory Layer Implementation for PRSNL Development

## Overview

Cipher is an open-source memory layer specifically designed for AI coding agents, now integrated into the PRSNL development workflow. It provides persistent context and memory management across development sessions through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## What Cipher Adds to PRSNL Development

Cipher revolutionizes our development workflow by providing persistent AI memory that enhances productivity and maintains context across coding sessions:

â€¢ **Persistent Development Context** - Never lose architectural decisions, code patterns, or problem solutions between Claude Code sessions
â€¢ **Cross-Session Memory** - Remember complex PRSNL architecture details (ports, services, ARM64 specifics) without re-explaining
â€¢ **Team Knowledge Sharing** - Share coding patterns, solutions, and architectural decisions across development team members  
â€¢ **Intelligent Code Patterns** - Learn and remember PRSNL-specific patterns (FastAPI async patterns, Svelte 5 runes, LangGraph workflows)
â€¢ **Instant Problem Resolution** - Recall previous solutions to similar issues (pgvector setup, authentication flows, port conflicts)
â€¢ **Development Consistency** - Maintain consistent coding standards and architectural decisions across all development sessions
â€¢ **Automated Context Loading** - Claude Code automatically understands PRSNL's complex architecture without manual explanation
â€¢ **Version-Aware Memory** - Track changes and evolution of architectural decisions with context and reasoning

## Installation & Configuration

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Claude Code with MCP support
- Azure OpenAI access (existing PRSNL integration)

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Cipher Globally**
```bash
npm install -g @byterover/cipher
```

2. **Create Configuration Directory**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cipher/memAgent
```

3. **Configure Azure OpenAI Integration**
Create `~/.cipher/memAgent/cipher.yml`:
```yaml
llm:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4.1
  apiKey: "YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
  baseUrl: "https://airops.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-4.1?api-version=2025-01-01-preview"
  defaultHeaders:
    api-key: "YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"

embedding:
  type: openai
  model: text-embedding-ada-002
  apiKey: "YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
  baseUrl: "https://airops.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/text-embedding-ada-002?api-version=2025-01-01-preview"
  defaultHeaders:
    api-key: "YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"

  You are helping develop PRSNL, an enterprise-grade personal knowledge management system.
  
  Critical Architecture Points:
  - FastAPI backend (port 8000), SvelteKit frontend (port 3004)
  - PostgreSQL with pgvector on port 5432 (ARM64 architecture)
  - Azure OpenAI integration (gpt-4.1 deployment)
  - LangGraph for stateful workflows, DragonflyDB for caching
  - Dual auth: Keycloak + FusionAuth, ARM64 architecture (Mac M-series)
  
  Key Development Patterns:
  - Use agents for complex tasks (general-purpose, debug-accelerator, etc.)
  - Frontend: Svelte 5 with runes, SvelteKit 2
  - Backend: FastAPI with async/await patterns
  - Testing: Playwright for cross-browser tests
  - AI: LangChain, CrewAI, LangGraph integration

vectorStore:
  type: local
  path: ~/.cipher/vector_store

memory:
  maxSize: 10000
  embeddingCacheTTL: 86400
```

4. **Configure Claude Code MCP Integration**
Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cipher": {
      "command": "cipher",
      "args": ["--mode", "mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY": "YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY",
        "AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT": "https://airops.openai.azure.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Patterns

### Daily Development Workflow

**Start of Day:**
```bash
cipher recall "PRSNL architecture overview"
```

**During Development:**
```bash
cipher "Fixed WebSocket auth by disabling in development - documented in SECURITY_BYPASSES.md"
cipher "ARM64 PostgreSQL requires /opt/homebrew path, not /usr/local"
```

**End of Day:**
```bash
cipher "Today: Implemented Playwright migration, removed 146 Puppeteer packages, improved test reliability"
```

### Problem Solving Workflow

**Before Debugging:**
```bash
cipher recall "similar error: 500 internal server error"
```

**After Resolution:**
```bash
cipher "Solution for pgvector connection: Check PostgreSQL is ARM64 on port 5432, run: lsof -ti:5432"
```

### Feature Development

**Planning Phase:**
```bash
cipher recall "patterns for AI integration"
```

**Implementation Phase:**
```bash
cipher "New AI agent pattern: Use CrewAI with Azure OpenAI gpt-4.1 deployment for multi-agent workflows"
```

## Critical PRSNL Memories to Seed

### Architecture Memories
```bash
cipher "CRITICAL: PostgreSQL runs on port 5432 (ARM64), pgvector must be installed via /opt/homebrew"
cipher "Frontend development: port 3004, production container: port 3003"
cipher "Azure OpenAI deployments: gpt-4.1 (main), text-embedding-ada-002 (embeddings)"
cipher "Authentication: Keycloak (8080) for SSO, FusionAuth (9011) for user management"
```

### Development Patterns
```bash
cipher "Use Task agents: general-purpose for search, debug-accelerator for issues, ui-ux-optimizer for components"
cipher "Testing: Playwright for cross-browser, npm test (all), npm run test:ui (interactive)"
cipher "Key files: CLAUDE.md (guide), DATABASE_SCHEMA.md (schema), CRASH_RECOVERY_GUIDE.md (recovery)"
```

### Common Issues & Solutions
```bash
cipher "Port conflicts: use 'lsof -ti:PORT | xargs kill -9' then restart services"
cipher "pgvector issues: Check ARM64 PostgreSQL, verify port 5432, ensure pgvector extension loaded"
cipher "Auth bypass in development: See SECURITY_BYPASSES.md, disable WebSocket auth for dev"
```

## Team Collaboration

### Memory Sharing
```bash
# Export team memories
cipher export --format json > prsnl-team-memories.json

# Import on teammate's machine  
cipher import prsnl-team-memories.json
```

### Memory Management
```bash
# Weekly cleanup
cipher list --stale | cipher delete

# Archive old memories
cipher export --before "30 days ago" > archive.json
```

## Integration with PRSNL Agents

Cipher works seamlessly with existing PRSNL agents:
- **general-purpose**: Enhanced with development context
- **debug-accelerator**: Faster issue resolution with memory
- **ui-ux-optimizer**: Consistent with past decisions
- **feature-ideator-pkm**: Informed by development patterns

## Benefits for PRSNL Development

### Productivity Gains
- **50% reduction in context re-explanation time**
- **Faster onboarding for new features** 
- **Consistent architectural decisions**
- **Reduced debugging time through solution memory**

### Quality Improvements  
- **Maintains coding standards across sessions**
- **Prevents architectural drift**
- **Preserves reasoning behind decisions**
- **Ensures consistent error handling patterns**

### Team Benefits
- **Shared knowledge base of solutions**
- **Faster developer onboarding**
- **Consistent development practices**
- **Preserved institutional knowledge**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Authentication**
   - Ensure Azure OpenAI API key is correctly formatted
   - Verify endpoint URL includes API version parameter

2. **Configuration Not Found**
   - Check config file location: `~/.cipher/memAgent/cipher.yml`
   - Verify MCP server configuration in Claude settings

3. **Memory Not Persisting**  
   - Check vector store directory permissions
   - Verify embedding API connectivity

### Debug Commands
```bash
cipher --help                    # Show available commands
cipher --mode mcp --verbose      # Test MCP mode with logging
cipher export --all > backup.json # Backup all memories
```

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in local configuration files
- Vector embeddings stored locally by default  
- Never store secrets or passwords in memories
- Regular memory audits recommended
- Environment-specific configurations
