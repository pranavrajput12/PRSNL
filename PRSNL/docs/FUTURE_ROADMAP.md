# PRSNL Future Development Roadmap

This document outlines medium and long-term improvements for the PRSNL project, based on expert engineering recommendations. Each item includes a complexity/time/impact score to help prioritize implementation.

## Medium-Term Improvements (Next 1-3 Months)

### 1. Docker Development Environment as Code (Score: 6.7/10)
**What**: Fully containerize the development environment with docker-compose as the single source of truth.

**Why**: Eliminates "works on my machine" issues and ensures consistent development environments.

**Implementation**:
- Create comprehensive docker-compose.dev.yml with all services
- Mount source code as volumes for hot-reloading
- Include development tools (debuggers, profilers) in containers
- Create .env.development with all default values
- Add Makefile targets for common dev tasks

**Benefits**:
- New developers can start with just `make dev`
- Consistent Python, Node.js, and system library versions
- Easier CI/CD pipeline setup

### 2. Single Source of Truth for Configuration (Score: 7.7/10)
**What**: Centralize all configuration in one place with validation and type safety.

**Why**: Reduces configuration drift and makes the system more maintainable.

**Implementation**:
- Create a central configuration service
- Use Pydantic for backend config validation
- Use Zod for frontend config validation
- Generate TypeScript types from backend schemas
- Single .env file that feeds all services
- Configuration documentation auto-generated from schemas

**Benefits**:
- Type-safe configuration across the stack
- Automatic validation and error messages
- Self-documenting configuration

### 3. Automated Recovery Scripts (Score: 6.3/10)
**What**: Scripts that can automatically detect and recover from common failure states.

**Why**: Reduces manual intervention and improves developer experience.

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Example recovery scenarios:
- Port conflicts: Kill conflicting processes
- Stale containers: Clean and restart
- Database migrations: Auto-apply on startup
- Cache corruption: Clear and rebuild
- Missing dependencies: Auto-install
```

**Key Scripts**:
- `scripts/auto_recover.sh`: Detects and fixes common issues
- `scripts/health_monitor.sh`: Continuous health checking
- Integration with systemd/launchd for auto-restart

## Long-Term Improvements (3-6 Months)

### 4. Granular Observability (Score: 5.7/10)
**What**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing across all services.

**Why**: Essential for debugging production issues and understanding system behavior.

**Implementation**:
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- OpenTelemetry integration for tracing
- Prometheus metrics for all key operations
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Log aggregation with Loki or ELK stack

**Benefits**:
- Quick root cause analysis
- Performance bottleneck identification
- User behavior insights

### 5. Progressive Enhancement Architecture (Score: 5.7/10)
**What**: Build features that gracefully degrade when dependencies are unavailable.

**Why**: Improves resilience and user experience.

**Implementation**:
- Fallback UI when backend is down
- Local-first data with sync when online
- Feature detection and conditional loading
- Service worker for offline functionality
- Graceful degradation for AI features

**Example**:
```javascript
// Instead of failing when AI is unavailable:
if (aiService.isAvailable()) {
  summary = await aiService.summarize(content);
} else {
  summary = extractFirstParagraph(content);
}
```

## Ideas NOT Recommended

These ideas were evaluated but deemed too complex or low-value for the current stage:

### ❌ Event-Driven Architecture (Score: 3.7/10)
- **Why not**: Major refactor with minimal benefit for current scale
- **Alternative**: Keep simple request-response pattern, add queues only where needed

### ❌ Test Harness with Mocked Dependencies (Score: 4.7/10)
- **Why not**: High maintenance overhead, integration tests more valuable
- **Alternative**: Focus on smoke tests and end-to-end tests

### ❌ Feature Flags System (Score: 5.0/10)
- **Why not**: Overkill for single-deployment application
- **Alternative**: Simple environment variables for feature toggles

## Implementation Priority

Based on impact and effort, implement in this order:

1. **Single Source of Truth** - High impact on daily development
2. **Docker Dev Environment** - Solves environment issues permanently
3. **Automated Recovery** - Saves time on common problems
4. **Observability** - Important for production
5. **Progressive Enhancement** - Nice to have for resilience

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics to validate improvements:
- Time to onboard new developer (target: < 30 minutes)
- Frequency of "works on my machine" issues (target: 0)
- Mean time to recovery from failures (target: < 5 minutes)
- Developer satisfaction scores

## Next Steps

1. Start with configuration centralization (can be done incrementally)
2. Gradually containerize remaining services
3. Add recovery scripts as issues are encountered
4. Plan observability stack for production deployment
