   ```
2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```
3. Test the integration by:
   - Checking if the homepage loads and shows real item count and stats
   - Verifying timeline page loads real items with infinite scroll
   - Testing search functionality with real backend results
   - Creating new items through the UI and seeing them appear in the timeline
   - Verifying that loading states and error handling work correctly
