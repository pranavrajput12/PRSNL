# Task Summary: PRSNL Chrome Extension v2.0.0 Update

## Overview

This task involved a complete overhaul of the PRSNL Chrome Extension to align with backend v4.1.0 and implement the new "Neural Chip Module" design concept. The extension is now a futuristic, AI-powered capture tool that seamlessly integrates with the PRSNL ecosystem.

## Key Changes

### 1. Design and UI/UX

- **Neural Chip Module Design:** Implemented a dark, futuristic theme with circuit board patterns, a rotating 3D Mac Classic model, and various visual effects to create an immersive user experience.
- **New Components:** Created chip-style buttons, PCB trace connectors, and a heat sink-style header to reinforce the "neural processing unit" concept.
- **Animations:** Added smooth CSS animations for micro-interactions, data flow visualizations, and processing indicators.

### 2. Core Functionality

- **`manifest.json`:** Updated to version `2.0.0`, with updated permissions and host permissions for the new frontend port (`3003`).
- **Enhanced Capture Form:** The popup now includes a content type selector, collapsible development-specific fields, an AI summarization toggle, and a tag input field.
- **Smart Content Type Detection:** The extension automatically detects the content type based on the URL (e.g., GitHub, YouTube, Medium) and adjusts the form accordingly.
- **Backend Integration:** The capture logic has been updated to send the new data fields to the backend API, including development-specific metadata.

### 3. Technical Implementation

- **Three.js Integration:** Integrated the Three.js library to render the 3D Mac Classic model in the popup.
- **WebSocket Integration:** The extension now connects to the backend via WebSockets for real-time updates and notifications.
- **Code Refactor:** The `popup.js`, `background.js`, and `content.js` scripts have been significantly updated to support the new features and improve performance.
