# Task Summary

## Task Description
Update the PRSNL frontend to connect to the live backend API instead of using sample data. The backend is running at http://localhost:8000.

## Changes Made
### Files Modified:
- `/PRSNL/frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - Updated API base URL and endpoints to match backend API
- `/PRSNL/frontend/src/routes/+page.svelte` - Updated homepage to use real data from API
- `/PRSNL/frontend/src/routes/timeline/+page.svelte` - Updated timeline page to use real data from API
- `/PRSNL/frontend/src/routes/search/+page.svelte` - Updated search page to use real data from API
- `/PRSNL/frontend/src/lib/components/ErrorMessage.svelte` - Added TypeScript types for better error handling

### Files Removed:
- `/PRSNL/frontend/src/lib/data/sampleData.js` - Removed sample data file as it's no longer needed

### Changes Details:
1. API Client Updates:
   - Set API base URL to `http://localhost:8000/api` (based on actual backend API structure)
   - Verified and updated API client methods to match backend endpoints:
     - Kept item creation endpoint as `/capture` (confirmed from API docs)
     - Kept timeline endpoint as `/timeline?page=${page}` (confirmed from API docs)
     - Changed tags endpoint from `/tags/recent` to `/tags`
     - Updated search endpoint to use `query` parameter instead of `q` (`/search?query={query}`)
   - Added `getTags()` function to fetch all tags from the backend
   - Removed the `/v1` path segment as it's not used in the actual backend API

2. Homepage Updates:
   - Removed import and usage of `sampleData.js`
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for proper type checking
   - Implemented real data fetching using `getTimeline()` and `getTags()` API methods
   - Added loading states with spinner components
   - Implemented error handling with retry and dismiss options
   - Updated stats display to show real data: total items, today's items, and total tags

3. Timeline Page Updates:
   - Removed import and usage of `sampleData.js`
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for proper type checking
   - Implemented real data fetching using `getTimeline()` API method
   - Fixed infinite scroll to work with real API pagination
   - Added proper error handling and loading states

4. Search Page Updates:
   - Removed import and usage of `sampleData.js`
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for proper type checking
   - Implemented real search using `searchItems()` API method
   - Fixed keyboard navigation and result highlighting
   - Added proper error handling and loading states

## Setup/Testing Instructions
1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```
3. Test the integration by:
   - Checking if the homepage loads and shows real item count and stats
   - Verifying timeline page loads real items with infinite scroll
   - Testing search functionality with real backend results
   - Creating new items through the UI and seeing them appear in the timeline
   - Verifying that loading states and error handling work correctly

## Notes
- All sample data has been removed and replaced with real API data
- TypeScript types have been added to improve code quality and catch errors
- Loading states and error handling have been implemented for better UX
- The Manchester United red theme has been maintained throughout the UI
