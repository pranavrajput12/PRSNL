### Task GEMINI-2025-07-06-001 (Video processing optimization)

**Description:** Optimized video processing for performance and reliability.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `PRSNL/backend/app/core/background_tasks.py` to manage asynchronous background tasks.
- Integrated `background_tasks` into `PRSNL/backend/app/main.py` for proper startup and shutdown.
- Modified `PRSNL/backend/app/api/capture.py` to:
    - Use `background_tasks` for video processing.
    - Implement video format validation before download.
    - Handle video processing in a background task (`process_video_item`).
    - Update item status to 'pending' initially and 'completed' or 'failed' after processing.
    - Add `_update_video_processing_progress` function to track progress.
- Modified `PRSNL/backend/app/services/video_processor.py` to:
    - Add video format validation.
    - Implement video compression for large files using `ffmpeg`.
    - Add progress tracking for video downloads via `_progress_hook`.
    - Implement retry logic for failed downloads in `yt-dlp` options.
    - Add video metadata extraction (resolution, codec, bitrate).
    - Implement video size limits using `settings.MAX_VIDEO_SIZE_MB`.
    - Ensure format conversion to MP4.
    - Generate thumbnails at multiple sizes.
    - Clean up temporary video files.
- Added `MAX_VIDEO_SIZE_MB` to `PRSNL/backend/app/config.py`.

**Verification:**
- The changes involve background processing and external tools (yt-dlp, ffmpeg). Full verification would require testing with actual video URLs and monitoring the background task execution and file outputs. This was not explicitly requested as part of the current task, but the code changes are in place to support these features.

### Task GEMINI-2025-07-06-002 (Storage Management System)

**Description:** Implemented robust storage management for media files.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `PRSNL/backend/app/services/storage_manager.py` with the following functionalities:
    - `get_storage_metrics()`: Returns current storage usage metrics.
    - `cleanup_orphaned_files()`: Removes video and thumbnail files not referenced in the database.
    - `cleanup_temp_files()`: Removes temporary files older than a specified duration.
    - Placeholder methods for `check_user_quota()` and `backup_media_files()`.
- Created `PRSNL/backend/app/api/admin.py` with a `GET /storage/metrics` endpoint.
- Included the `admin` router in `PRSNL/backend/app/main.py`.
- Integrated periodic calls to `cleanup_orphaned_files()` and `cleanup_temp_files()` as background tasks in `PRSNL/backend/app/main.py`.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed with Task GEMINI-2025-07-06-003 (Video API Endpoints) as per `GEMINI_TASKS.md`.
