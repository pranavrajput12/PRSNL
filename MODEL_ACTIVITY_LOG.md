### Task GEMINI-2025-07-06-001 (Video processing optimization)

**Description:** Optimized video processing for performance and reliability.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `PRSNL/backend/app/core/background_tasks.py` to manage asynchronous background tasks.
- Integrated `background_tasks` into `PRSNL/backend/app/main.py` for proper startup and shutdown.
- Modified `PRSNL/backend/app/api/capture.py` to:
    - Use `background_tasks` for video processing.
    - Implement video format validation before download.
    - Handle video processing in a background task (`process_video_item`).
    - Update item status to 'pending' initially and 'completed' or 'failed' after processing.
    - Add `_update_video_processing_progress` function to track progress.
- Modified `PRSNL/backend/app/services/video_processor.py` to:
    - Add video format validation.
    - Implement video compression for large files using `ffmpeg`.
    - Add progress tracking for video downloads via `_progress_hook`.
    - Implement retry logic for failed downloads in `yt-dlp` options.
    - Add video metadata extraction (resolution, codec, bitrate).
    - Implement video size limits using `settings.MAX_VIDEO_SIZE_MB`.
    - Ensure format conversion to MP4.
    - Generate thumbnails at multiple sizes.
    - Clean up temporary video files.
- Added `MAX_VIDEO_SIZE_MB` to `PRSNL/backend/app/config.py`.

**Verification:**
- The changes involve background processing and external tools (yt-dlp, ffmpeg). Full verification would require testing with actual video URLs and monitoring the background task execution and file outputs. This was not explicitly requested as part of the current task, but the code changes are in place to support these features.

### Task GEMINI-2025-07-06-002 (Storage Management System)

**Description:** Implemented robust storage management for media files.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `PRSNL/backend/app/services/storage_manager.py` with the following functionalities:
    - `get_storage_metrics()`: Returns current storage usage metrics.
    - `cleanup_orphaned_files()`: Removes video and thumbnail files not referenced in the database.
    - `cleanup_temp_files()`: Removes temporary files older than a specified duration.
    - Placeholder methods for `check_user_quota()` and `backup_media_files()`.
- Created `PRSNL/backend/app/api/admin.py` with a `GET /storage/metrics` endpoint.
- Included the `admin` router in `PRSNL/backend/app/main.py`.
- Integrated periodic calls to `cleanup_orphaned_files()` and `cleanup_temp_files()` as background tasks in `PRSNL/backend/app/main.py`.

### Task GEMINI-2025-07-06-003 (Video API Endpoints)

**Description:** Created dedicated video management endpoints.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `PRSNL/backend/app/models/video.py` with Pydantic models for video data, transcoding requests/responses, and delete responses.
- Created `PRSNL/backend/app/api/videos.py` with the following endpoints:
    - `GET /videos/{item_id}/stream`: Video streaming endpoint.
    - `GET /videos/{item_id}/metadata`: Video metadata retrieval.
    - `POST /videos/{item_id}/transcode`: Requests video transcoding as a background task.
    - `DELETE /videos/{item_id}`: Initiates video and associated file deletion as a background task.
- Included the `videos` router in `PRSNL/backend/app/main.py`.

### Task GEMINI-2025-07-06-004 (Platform Support Extension)

**Description:** Extended video support beyond Instagram.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `PRSNL/backend/app/services/platforms/` directory.
- Created `PRSNL/backend/app/services/platforms/__init__.py` with a base `PlatformProcessor` abstract class.
- Created platform-specific processor files:
    - `PRSNL/backend/app/services/platforms/instagram.py`
    - `PRSNL/backend/app/services/platforms/youtube.py`
    - `PRSNL/backend/app/services/platforms/twitter.py`
    - `PRSNL/backend/app/services/platforms/tiktok.py`
- Modified `PRSNL/backend/app/services/video_processor.py` to utilize these new modular platform processors for `validate_video_url` and `download_video`.

### Task GEMINI-2025-07-06-005 (Performance Monitoring)

**Description:** Added comprehensive monitoring for video operations.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `PRSNL/backend/app/monitoring/metrics.py` to define Prometheus metrics for:
    - Video capture requests (total, status).
    - Video download duration (platform).
    - Video download outcomes (platform, outcome).
    - Video processing duration (outcome).
    - Storage usage (type).
    - Orphaned file cleanup operations (status).
    - Temporary file cleanup operations (status).
    - Video processing queue size.
- Integrated metrics into `PRSNL/backend/app/api/capture.py` to track video capture requests and download outcomes.
- Integrated metrics into `PRSNL/backend/app/services/video_processor.py` to track video download and processing durations and outcomes.
- Integrated metrics into `PRSNL/backend/app/services/storage_manager.py` to track storage usage and cleanup operations.
- Integrated metrics into `PRSNL/backend/app/api/admin.py` to expose storage metrics.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## 🤖 CLAUDE (Main Orchestrator)

### 2025-07-06 Session (Latest)
**Task ID**: CLAUDE-2025-07-06-002  
**Description**: Debug frontend issues and integrate all model work  
**Files Modified**:
- `/PRSNL/backend/app/config.py` (fixed CORS for port 3002)
