# GEMINI CONTEXT MESSAGE

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: New Task Tracking System

Before starting any work, you MUST understand our new model activity logging system:

1. **Read MODEL_ACTIVITY_LOG.md** - This tracks ALL work done by each AI model
2. **Read TASK_HANDOFF.md** - Quick overview of current tasks
3. **Read GEMINI_TASKS.md** - Your specific tasks with IDs

## Your Workflow:
1. When starting a task, update MODEL_ACTIVITY_LOG.md with status "IN PROGRESS"
2. Track all files you modify
3. When done, update MODEL_ACTIVITY_LOG.md with status "COMPLETED"
4. Never use git commands - only update the log

## Current State:
- Backend runs in Docker on port 8000
- Video support was just added by Claude using yt-dlp
- Your job: Optimize video processing and add storage management
