# GEMINI TASKS - Backend/Infrastructure Specialist

## Current Context
The PRSNL project has just added Instagram video download support using yt-dlp. The video processing pipeline is implemented but needs optimization, testing, and infrastructure improvements. Videos are stored locally in the Docker container.

## Important Files to Review First
1. `/PRSNL/backend/app/services/video_processor.py` - Video download implementation
2. `/PRSNL/backend/app/api/capture.py` - Updated capture endpoint
3. `/PRSNL/backend/app/db/migrations/002_add_video_support.sql` - Video schema
4. `/PRSNL/docker-compose.yml` - Container configuration
5. `/SESSION_CONTINUITY.md` - Current project state

## Task 1: Video Processing Pipeline Optimization
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Task ID**: GEMINI-2025-07-06-001

**Task ID**: GEMINI-2025-07-06-003  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Description**: Created dedicated video management endpoints, including streaming, metadata retrieval, transcoding (placeholder), and deletion.

## Task 4: Platform Support Extension
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Task ID**: GEMINI-2025-07-06-004  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Description**: Extended video support beyond Instagram to include YouTube, Twitter/X, and TikTok. Confirmed existing implementations of platform-specific processors and their utilization by `VideoProcessor`.

## Task 5: Telegram Bot Integration
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Task ID**: GEMINI-2025-07-06-005  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Description**: Implemented Telegram bot for capturing links and videos. All requirements met, including video message processing.

## Task 6: Performance Monitoring
**Priority**: LOW  
**Task ID**: GEMINI-2025-07-06-006  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Description**: Added comprehensive monitoring for video operations, including Prometheus metrics for various aspects of video processing and storage, and integrated them into relevant API endpoints and services.

## Task 7: Mock Data
**Priority**: P0 - DEMO CRITICAL
**Task ID**: GEMINI-2025-07-06-007
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Description**: Added mock data to the PostgreSQL database for demo purposes.

## Task 8: Database Optimization
**Priority**: P1
**Task ID**: GEMINI-2025-07-06-009
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Description**: Added indexes to the PostgreSQL database for common queries.

## Task 9: Docker Production Setup
**Priority**: P2
**Task ID**: GEMINI-2025-07-06-010
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Description**: Created a production-ready Docker Compose file.

## Task 10: Monitoring & Logging
**Priority**: P2
**Task ID**: GEMINI-2025-07-06-011
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Description**: Configured Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch, and Kibana for monitoring and logging.

## Task 11: CI/CD Pipeline
**Priority**: P2
**Task ID**: GEMINI-2025-07-06-012
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Description**: Created a basic GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD.

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test with videos > 100MB
- [ ] Test concurrent video downloads
- [ ] Test storage cleanup procedures
- [ ] Test video streaming performance
- [ ] Test error handling for invalid URLs
- [ ] Load test with 10+ simultaneous downloads

## Infrastructure Considerations
1. **Docker Volume**: Currently using local volume, consider named volumes
2. **Backup Strategy**: Implement automated backup for media files
3. **Scaling**: Prepare for horizontal scaling of video processors
4. **Caching**: Implement Redis for video metadata caching
5. **CDN Ready**: Structure files for easy CDN integration

## Notes
- Backend runs in Docker container
- Media files stored at `/app/media/` inside container
- Use PostgreSQL for metadata, filesystem for media
- Maintain high performance (sub-second response times)
- DO NOT use git commands directly - update MODEL_ACTIVITY_LOG.md instead

## Success Criteria
- Video processing is reliable and fast
- Storage is efficiently managed
- All platforms supported smoothly
- System scales with load
- Comprehensive monitoring in place
