# Task Summary

## Task: Fix Semantic Search API
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Description**:
- Fixed a bug in the `/api/search/similar/{item_id}` endpoint in `search.py` that was causing a variable scoping issue and preventing results from being returned correctly.
- Corrected an issue in the same endpoint where `get_db_pool()` was being called instead of using the dependency-injected `db_connection`.
- Updated the `find_similar_items_by_embedding` function in `database.py` to accept a database connection as its first argument, ensuring consistency with other database functions.
- Refactored the `/api/search/semantic` endpoint in `search.py` to use the updated `find_similar_items_by_embedding` function and properly format the response.
