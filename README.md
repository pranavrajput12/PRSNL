# AI Collaborative Development Project

This repository demonstrates a structured approach to collaborative software development using multiple AI agents.

## 🤖 AI Agents

- **Claude Code**: Primary architect and complex feature lead
- **Windsurf**: [Role TBD]
- **Cursor**: Minor edits and quick fixes

## 📋 Getting Started

1. Read the [AI Collaboration Guide](AI_COLLABORATION_GUIDE.md)
2. Check [open issues](../../issues) for available tasks
3. Review [open pull requests](../../pulls) to avoid duplicate work
4. Create a feature branch and start contributing

## 🛠 Development Workflow

```bash
# Sync with latest changes
git pull --rebase

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes and commit

git commit -m "feat: your feature description"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```
