# SESSION CONTINUITY - PRSNL Project
> CRITICAL: This file ensures Claude picks up EXACTLY where we left off. Update at session end.

## Last Updated: July 6, 2025

## IMMEDIATE CONTEXT
We are implementing the PRSNL (Personal Knowledge Vault) project - a keyboard-first knowledge management system. The project is 95% complete with all major components integrated. Main work remaining: Testing and documentation.

## CURRENT TASK IN PROGRESS
**Task**: Documentation Updates
**Status**: ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS - Updating all docs with current state
**Why**: Major features completed, need to document the current system state.

### What was done in this session:
1. Fixed frontend 500 error (missing TypeScript preprocessor)
2. Standardized frontend port to 3002
3. Added Instagram video download support (yt-dlp)
4. Updated database schema for video support
5. Created VideoPlayer component for frontend
6. Integrated Azure OpenAI as fallback for Ollama
7. Wired up capture endpoint to use real CaptureEngine

## EXACT NEXT STEPS
1. âœ… **All services integrated and running**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3002 (on host machine)
   - Backend: http://localhost:8000 (in Docker)
   - Database: PostgreSQL with pgvector (in Docker)
   - Ollama: Local AI processing (in Docker)
   - Azure OpenAI: Configured as fallback

2. âœ… **Video support implemented**
   - Instagram video download with yt-dlp
   - Database schema updated with video fields
   - VideoPlayer component created
   - Media storage directories configured

3. **IMMEDIATE TASKS**
   - Complete documentation updates
   - Test end-to-end capture flow
   - Test Instagram video capture
   - Performance optimization

## PROJECT STATUS SUMMARY
### âœ… Completed
- Frontend UI (SvelteKit, Manchester United red theme #dc143c)
- Chrome Extension (all features implemented)
- Backend API fully integrated (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker)
- All services running and healthy
- Database schema with video support
- Instagram video download support (yt-dlp)
- Azure OpenAI integration configured
- Frontend API proxy configured
- Capture endpoint using real CaptureEngine
- Search endpoint connected to database
- VideoPlayer component for media display
- Media storage directory structure

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Documentation updates (ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.)
- End-to-end testing

### ðŸ“‹ Pending
- Performance optimization
- Production deployment setup
- Comprehensive testing suite

## KEY PROJECT DETAILS
- **Architecture**: Frontend (SvelteKit) + Backend (FastAPI) + Extension (Chrome) + Database (PostgreSQL)
- **Design**: Manchester United red (#dc143c) throughout
- **Principles**: Local-first, zero-cost, privacy-focused, keyboard-centric
- **Performance**: Target sub-second search on 100k+ items

## ACTIVE TODO LIST
1. âœ… Backend fully integrated
2. âœ… Frontend connected to live APIs
3. âœ… Video support implemented
4. âœ… Azure OpenAI configured
5. ðŸš§ Update all documentation
6. ðŸ“‹ Test end-to-end capture flow
7. ðŸ“‹ Test Instagram video capture
8. ðŸ“‹ Performance optimization
9. ðŸ“‹ Production deployment setup

## SESSION NOTES
- User expressed frustration about losing context between sessions
- Frontend runs on host (not in Docker) for better dev experience
- Port confusion resolved: standardized to 3002
- All major features now implemented and integrated
- Focus shifting to testing and documentation

## COMMAND REMINDERS
```bash
# Start development
make dev

# View logs
make logs

# Stop services
make down

# Frontend dev server (now on port 3002)
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Backend direct access
cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload
```
