# SESSION CONTINUITY - PRSNL Project
> CRITICAL: This file ensures Claude picks up EXACTLY where we left off. Update at session end.

## Last Updated: January 6, 2025

## IMMEDIATE CONTEXT
We are implementing the PRSNL (Personal Knowledge Vault) project - a keyboard-first knowledge management system. The project is 85% complete with frontend and Chrome extension done, backend structure ready. Main work remaining: Backend integration.

## CURRENT TASK IN PROGRESS
**Task**: Backend Integration (connecting frontend to live APIs)
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED - Backend is running successfully
**Why**: Frontend currently uses sample data. Need to connect to real backend for full functionality.

### What was done:
1. Fixed Docker setup issues (pgvector, build-essential, PATH)
2. Fixed Python import issues (readability-lxml)
3. Backend now running on http://localhost:8000
4. All health checks passing (Database, Ollama, Disk)

## EXACT NEXT STEPS
1. âœ… **Backend services running**
   - Docker containers: db (PostgreSQL), backend (FastAPI), ollama
   - Database schema applied with pgvector extension
   - 20 sample items seeded with tags

2. âœ… **Frontend API configuration updated** (by Windsurf)
   - API client updated to use `http://localhost:8000/api`
   - BUT: Frontend still imports sampleData in some components

3. **IMMEDIATE TASKS**
   - Complete frontend integration (remove sample data imports)
   - Wire up search endpoint to use real SearchEngine
   - Test end-to-end functionality
   - Fix homepage card display issue

## PROJECT STATUS SUMMARY
### âœ… Completed
- Frontend UI (SvelteKit, Manchester United red theme #dc143c)
- Chrome Extension (all features implemented)
- Backend structure (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker)
- Backend services running (all containers healthy)
- Database schema applied with pgvector extension
- Database seeded with 20 items and 7 tags
- API client updated to use http://localhost:8000/api
- Development environment fully operational
- Documentation cleanup

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Frontend still imports sampleData in components
- Search endpoint returns mock data (not using SearchEngine)

### ðŸ“‹ Pending
- Complete frontend integration (remove sample data imports)
- Wire search endpoint to real database
- Test end-to-end capture flow
- Chrome extension testing with backend
- Production deployment setup

## KEY PROJECT DETAILS
- **Architecture**: Frontend (SvelteKit) + Backend (FastAPI) + Extension (Chrome) + Database (PostgreSQL)
- **Design**: Manchester United red (#dc143c) throughout
- **Principles**: Local-first, zero-cost, privacy-focused, keyboard-centric
- **Performance**: Target sub-second search on 100k+ items

## ACTIVE TODO LIST
1. Create SESSION_CONTINUITY.md âœ… (just completed)
2. Update CURRENT_STATE.md with specific next actions
3. Connect frontend to live backend APIs (NEXT)
4. Test end-to-end capture flow
5. Implement real-time search
6. Set up database with production data
7. Test Chrome extension
8. Create production Docker config
9. Fix homepage card display issue

## SESSION NOTES
- User expressed frustration about losing context between sessions
- Created this file to prevent future time loss
- Must update this file at end of each session
- Should read this FIRST when starting any new session

## COMMAND REMINDERS
```bash
# Start development
make dev

# View logs
make logs

# Stop services
make down

# Frontend dev server
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Backend direct access
cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## CRITICAL FILES TO CHECK
1. `/SESSION_CONTINUITY.md` (THIS FILE - read first!)
2. `/CURRENT_STATE.md` (project snapshot)
3. `/docs/progress/TASK_TRACKER.md` (detailed task status)
4. `/docs/architecture/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md` (system design)
