# Build Fixes Applied

## Swift Compilation Errors Fixed:

1. **MainActor isolation errors in PRSNLApp.swift**
   - Added `@MainActor` annotations to WebSocket services
   - Fixed init method to be MainActor-isolated

2. **SyncStatus ambiguity**
   - Removed duplicate `SyncStatus` enum from SearchViewModel
   - Now using the single definition from SyncManager

3. **Missing CoreData import**
   - Added `import CoreData` to SyncManager.swift

4. **NetworkMonitor ObservableObject conformance**
   - Made NetworkMonitor conform to ObservableObject protocol

5. **iOS 16 API availability**
   - Added availability checks for ProposedViewSize in CaptureView
   - Added fallback implementation for iOS 15

## Next Steps:

1. Clean build folder: Product → Clean Build Folder (⌘⇧K)
2. Build the project: Product → Build (⌘B)
3. Run on simulator: Product → Run (⌘R)

## If you still see errors:

- Make sure your deployment target is set correctly (iOS 15.0 or later)
- Ensure all Swift packages are resolved
- Try deleting DerivedData again

The app should now compile successfully!
