- [x] Item detail view (with attachment display)
- [x] Capture screen (full form with tags, validation, API integration)
- [x] Settings (API configuration, connection testing, cache management)
- [x] Share extension (with URL, text, and image support)
- [x] Widget extension (with timeline, item previews)
- [ ] WebSocket integration
- [x] Offline support (Core Data persistence, SyncManager, NetworkMonitor)
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Current Blockers
*No blockers at this time*

## Architecture Decisions Made
- SwiftUI for UI framework (iOS 17+)
- MVVM architecture with Combine
- URLSession with async/await for networking
- Core Data for persistent storage
- Keychain for secure API key storage
- Manchester United red theme (#DC143C)
- Attachment handling with AsyncImage for images
- App Groups for data sharing between app and extensions

## Task Allocation

### Kilo Code Responsibilities
- ✅ API client implementation and fixes
- ✅ Core models implementation with Attachment support
- ✅ Timeline view and view model
- ✅ Item detail view with attachment display
- ✅ Search feature implementation
- ✅ Core Data persistence setup
- ✅ Basic offline support implementation

### Claude Responsibilities
- ✅ Capture feature implementation
- ✅ Settings screen implementation
- ✅ Share extension setup (with image support!)
- ✅ Widget extension implementation
- ⏳ Advanced offline support enhancements (Capture-Core Data integration)
- ⏳ Performance optimization

## Questions for Claude
- Any questions about the current architecture or model implementation?
- Do you need any specific helper methods added to the API client for the Capture feature?

## Next Steps
1. **Kilo Code**: (Week 1 & 2 goals completed)
   - ✅ Search functionality implementation
   - ✅ Core Data persistence
   - ✅ Basic offline support
   - ✅ SyncManager implementation

2. **Claude**: (Week 3 completed)
   - ✅ Capture feature with full form validation
   - ✅ Settings screen with API configuration
   - ✅ Share Extension implementation (Complete with image support!)
   - ✅ Widget extension implementation (Timeline and data access)
   - ⚠️ App icon implementation (enhanced_app_icons.py created, but icon still not appearing correctly)
   - ✅ Animated launch screen
   - ⏳ Integrate Capture with Core Data for offline queuing
   - ⏳ Performance optimization

3. **Both**: 
   - Test end-to-end offline functionality
   - WebSocket integration for real-time updates

## Testing Questions
1. Are attachment thumbnails displaying correctly?
2. Is the API key being properly stored in the Keychain?
3. Is the Timeline loading as expected?
4. Do widgets refresh properly when data changes?
5. Does the share extension properly save to the Core Data store?

## Performance Metrics to Track
- App launch time (target: < 1 second)
- Search response time (target: < 500ms)
- Timeline scrolling performance (target: 60fps)
- Memory usage (target: < 100MB)
- Widget refresh time (target: < 500ms)

## Notes
- Backend running on http://localhost:8000
- Recent backend update: Items now have attachments array for article images
- Test API key: `test-api-key-for-development`
- App group identifier: `group.ai.prsnl.shared`
- Replace placeholder Team ID "ABC12DEF34" with actual Apple Developer Team ID before deployment
