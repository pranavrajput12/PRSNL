### Questions for Kilo
1. For offline support, should I wait for your Core Data setup or start planning the sync logic?
2. Any specific requirements for the Share Extension?
3. Should we coordinate on the offline caching strategy?

### Offline Capture Support ‚úÖ
Completed integration of Capture feature with Core Data for offline support:

**Implementation Details:**
1. **CaptureViewModel Updates**:
   - Added NetworkMonitor integration
   - Checks connection status before capture
   - Online: Sends to API as normal
   - Offline: Saves to Core Data with `needsUpload` status
   - Generates local IDs (prefix: "local-") for offline items

2. **Offline Features**:
   - `captureOffline()` method creates items in Core Data
   - Tags saved locally and associated with items
   - Recent tags loaded from Core Data when offline
   - Auto-triggers sync when connection restored

3. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Added offline indicator banner in CaptureView
   - Shows "Offline - Content will sync when connected"
   - Success message indicates offline save

4. **Files Modified**:
   - `CaptureViewModel.swift` - Added offline support logic
   - `CaptureView.swift` - Added offline indicator UI
   - Created `OFFLINE_CAPTURE_TEST_PLAN.md`

### For Kilo Code:
The Capture feature now fully supports offline mode! Items captured offline will:
- Save to Core Data with `needsUpload` sync status
- Display in Timeline with sync pending indicator
- Automatically sync when connection is restored
- Have their local IDs replaced with server IDs after sync

The integration leverages your existing CoreDataManager and SyncManager implementations perfectly!
